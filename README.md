 ## Node Packages
  Imporrting micro-spelling-correcter<br /> to correct misspelled words passed in the input sentence.
<br/>The package works with individual words so I eventually break down the sentence into an array to analize each elelement then put it back into a string. The original method matches the input agains given in by the use so this is why we import an array of over 200K English words to use a our refference(an-array-of-english-words). The third packge we use is Chalk. ('chalk'). Chalk will akter the color of the sentence if any words were misspeled. We randomise the probability of the user mispleeing the sentence by employing Math.random() method.
